"""Build the application icon from the same Clawd SVG the UI uses.

Three platforms want three shapes, so the output format follows the path:

    uv run python tools/gen_icon.py installer/agent-gauge.ico     # Windows
    uv run python tools/gen_icon.py build/AgentGauge.iconset      # macOS
    uv run python tools/gen_icon.py build/icons                    # Linux

The .iconset is a directory in the layout `iconutil -c icns` expects; the macOS
build script runs that conversion, because Apple's own tool is the only way to
be sure the container is one macOS will accept. A bare directory gets the
freedesktop icon sizes for a hicolor theme.

Every size is rendered from the vector rather than downsampled from one large
bitmap: at 16 and 20 pixels the mascot is a handful of blocks, and resampling
turns them to mush.

The ICO container is assembled here instead of through Pillow on purpose:
importing PIL into a PySide6 process loads a second libpng/zlib, and Qt's PNG
encoder then dies with an access violation. Writing the container by hand is
some 40 lines and keeps the build free of that whole class of DLL clash.
