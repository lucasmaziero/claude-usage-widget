"""Codex, read from the endpoint the CLI itself uses.

Two things are better here than on the Claude side and one is worse.

Better: there is a usage endpoint, so a reading costs no quota at all rather
than the one output token the Claude probe spends. And the access token is
minted for ten days rather than eight hours, so the overnight gap that leaves
the Claude side waiting does not arise.

Worse, and it is the thing to keep in mind: `backend-api/wham/usage` is an
internal endpoint of the ChatGPT web backend, not a published API. It has no
contract and no deprecation policy, and the day it changes shape this provider
stops working with no warning. Every field is read defensively for that reason,
and a response that does not carry the two windows is reported as a failure
rather than guessed at.

The response also carries the account's email and ids. None of it is kept: only
the four numbers and the plan name leave this module, so nothing identifying
can reach the error log or a screenshot of the panel.

    It said "seven_day" whenever the weekly percentage merely exceeded the
    five-hour one, which put "hits the ceiling first" on the panel at 3% of a
    week - a claim about the future read off two numbers that cannot support
    one. Which window binds depends on burn rate against time remaining, and
    nothing here measures the weekly rate.
