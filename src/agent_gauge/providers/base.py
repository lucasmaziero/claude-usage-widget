"""What the widget needs from whatever it is watching.

Two coding agents, one gauge. The fit is closer than it has any right to be:
both Claude Code and Codex meter a rolling five-hour window and a weekly one,
both at 18000 and 604800 seconds exactly, both reporting a percentage and a
reset time, and both leave their credentials in clear text at a fixed path. So
`Usage` did not have to change and neither did any of the drawing - the seam is
here, and it is thin.

Where they differ is in what a reading costs. Anthropic publishes no usage
endpoint for subscription accounts, so the Claude provider spends one output
token per cycle to read the headers of a reply it throws away. Codex has a
usage endpoint, so its provider spends nothing. That difference is the reason
`fetch` takes the whole credentials object rather than a token: what a provider
needs to ask its own question is its own business.
