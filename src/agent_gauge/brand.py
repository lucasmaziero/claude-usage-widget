"""The marks the panel wears, one per agent it can watch.

Clawd is Claude Code's own mark, drawn from the official SVG. The Codex slot is
not OpenAI's logo and must not become it: that is their trademark, and putting
it on a third-party gauge would be claiming an endorsement nobody gave. What
sits there instead is a mascot of this project's own, built in Clawd's language
so the two read as a set - blocky silhouette, eyes as holes in the path, one
flat colour, and the same y 5..20 band of the viewBox so every size and centring
calculation below works unchanged for both.

Both are embedded as strings so there is no data file for PyInstaller to miss.
