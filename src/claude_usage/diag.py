"""A short record of failed cycles, for the bugs that only happen at 3am.

A widget that goes red while nobody is watching leaves nothing behind: the
message is on screen until the next cycle overwrites it, and by the time anyone
looks the app has recovered and the evidence is gone. This keeps the last few
hundred failures on disk with the context that tells them apart.

What it deliberately does not write: the access token, the refresh token, or
anything derived from either. Only whether a token had expired, and by how
long - which is the question, and is answerable from a timestamp.

Successes are not logged. The file should stay empty on a healthy machine, so
its size is itself a signal.
